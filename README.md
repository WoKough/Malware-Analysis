## HinataBot

**HinataBot is Go-based malware that the security researchers on Akamai’s SIRT recently found within HTTP and SSH honeypots. This particular sample stood out due to its large size and the lack of specific identification around its newer hashes. The malware binaries appear to have been named by the malware author after a character from the popular anime series, Naruto, with file name structures such as  Hinata-OS-Architecture.**
